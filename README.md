# C# Training Exercises

A collection of any C# related tutorials, exercises, classes, etc that I've done to learn new things.  Parentheses content indicate the folder in the repository.

## Training class presented by Mark Michaelis (CSharpTrainingClass)

I am participating in a 2 week C# training course.  Most days, there will be a
small exercise to do on our own that will give us an opportunity to use the
things we've learned from that day.

I'm hosting my exercises on Github so I can do them in the comfort of my home
on my desktop while having them available from my work and personal laptop
if I need them.  They'll also be nice to have once I have some real 
C# and .NET experience under my belt and can say "Wow, this really wasn't
good at all."  :)
